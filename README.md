#  **Customer Churn Data Insight Report**

## **Overview**
An in-depth analysis of customer behavior and service usage has been conducted to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn. The following insights provide a comprehensive understanding of trends and patterns observed within the dataset.

---

## **Churn Rate Summary**
- Based on the pie chart visualization, **26.54% of customers have churned**, indicating a moderate churn rate.
- This highlights the need to investigate underlying patterns and drivers behind customer attrition.

---

## **Demographic Trends**
- **Senior Citizens are more likely to churn** compared to other age groups, suggesting a potential disconnect in service relevance or accessibility for this demographic.
- Transforming the 'SeniorCitizen' field from binary (0/1) to categorical labels ('No'/'Yes') has improved data readability for further segmentation.

---

## **Tenure Analysis**
- Customers with **longer tenure are more likely to remain loyal**, demonstrating a clear correlation between service duration and retention.
- Conversely, customers with only **1–2 months of service history show significantly higher churn rates**, indicating challenges with early-stage customer engagement or onboarding.

---

## **Contract Type Impact**
- Churn is **considerably higher among customers on month-to-month contracts**, while those with **1- or 2-year contracts exhibit stronger retention**.
- This suggests that longer commitments promote loyalty and reduce attrition risk.

---

##  Service Usage Patterns
- **Non-churning customers typically subscribe to core services** such as:
  - **Phone Service**
  - **Internet Service** (particularly **DSL**)
  - **Online Security**
  
- **Optional services**, when not used or unavailable, correlate with increased churn:
  - **Online Backup**
  - **Tech Support**
  - **Streaming TV**

  This pattern implies that **engagement with multiple services** plays a role in customer stickiness.

---

##  Payment Method Insight
- Customers who use **Electronic Check** as their payment method exhibit **higher churn rates** than those using alternative options like credit card, bank transfer, or mailed check.
- This could reflect differences in customer profiles or convenience preferences and may be worth further behavioral segmentation.

---

##  Key Takeaways
- Encourage longer-term contracts to improve retention.
- Improve onboarding experience for new users (first 1–2 months).
- Promote bundling and adoption of optional services to increase engagement.
- Investigate and potentially incentivize use of alternative payment methods to reduce churn from electronic check users.
- Develop targeted strategies for senior citizens to address churn in that segment.
